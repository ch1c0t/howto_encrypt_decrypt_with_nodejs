== Introduction

A simple repository which illustrate how encryption and decryption can be done with Node.js.
It is based on
http://vancelucas.com/blog/stronger-encryption-and-decryption-in-node-js[this article].

== Usage

First, we ned to create a symmetric key. `coffee generate_key.coffee [path]` will create it and  write it to the `path`.
For example, `coffee generate_key.coffee /tmp/key` will write it into `/tmp/key`.

After this is done, we can use `coffee encrypt_and_decrypt.coffee [some_text]`
to encrypt and decrypt that text, and print it to stdout.

Under the hood, it uses

via the standart Node.js
https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html[crypto module].
