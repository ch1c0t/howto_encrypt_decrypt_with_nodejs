== Introduction

A simple repository which illustrate how encryption and decryption can be done with Node.js.
It is based on
http://vancelucas.com/blog/stronger-encryption-and-decryption-in-node-js[this article].

== Explanation

First, we will create a symmetric key and put it into an environment variable in
http://stackabuse.com/encoding-and-decoding-base64-strings-in-node-js[base64].

`coffee generate_key.coffee [filename]` will create an appropriate key and write it to the `filename`.
For example, `coffee generate_key.coffee symmetric.key` will store it to `symmetric.key` in the current working directory.

Then, we can put it into an environment variable like so:

[source,bash]
----
export ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(base64 symmetric.key)
----

After this is done, we can use `coffee encrypt_and_decrypt.coffee [some_text]`
to encrypt and decrypt that text, and print it to stdout.

Under the hood, it uses
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard[aes-256-cbc]
via the standart Node.js
https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html[crypto module].
